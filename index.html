	<h1>I really dig archeology!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Josh McDonald's archeological expeditions website. It is here you can find the latest updates on Josh's hobby: digging in the dirt.</p>

	<p>In the pic above I'm working at Tel Gezer in Israel in 2014</p>
	<p>Growing up watching movies like Indian Jones and of course all the hours spent watching History Channel shows only added to my interest in archeology. History is one of my favorite subjects to read and study. I've always had a love for old things. I used to scour the woods behind our house for old Inidan artifacts. I also used to spend hours in antique stores just looking around. I first got involved in archeology in my undergrad studies. Since that time in 2006 I've been on several great archeological expeditions in Israel. This website is about those expeditions. Thanks for checking out my story!</p>

	<p>The picture above was also taken at Tel Gezer. These are some of the tools used when in the field: buckets, wheelbarrow, sifter, and sand bags.</p>
	<p>Here is a website with more detail on the expeditions at <a href="http://www.telgezer.com"> Tel Gezer</a></p>
	<p>If that website doesn't work (the professor may be updating the website as they are currently diggin on site) some of the same information is covered in the wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezer">Tel Gezer</a></p>
	<h2>Below you'll find some information from some of my expeditions.</h2>
	<table border="1">

	<p>As the above table mentions I've had the privilage of working on three specific cites: Qumran, the Temple Mount, and Tel Gezer. As usual at all three sites we've dug up some incredible things. Below is a picture of three ancient juglets made of pottery that date back to 1000 B.C. All three jars come from Tel Gezer in Israel.</p>
